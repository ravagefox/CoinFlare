Crypto User Interface for accessing user specified APIs that are crypto related.

This program was intended to be used by Helix, Crexium AI specially built to monitor, buy, and sell crypto with the data it is
responsible for watching.

This program was also intended to allow for other developers to jump on board with a project that targets the automated learning
for computer learning, by importing data, and learning with it via the dummy system, the AI can learn to process when, how much,
and at what rate to buy/sell currency on the specified Crypto platform, using their API.


Things to do:
  1. Publish Helix.
  2. Create back track framework, to prevent Helix from lossing money. (In other words; Incorporate a dummy system with a publish cue)
  3. Clean up User interface, and make a modern UWP application, and deploy to other platforms.
  4. Make it 100% user friendly.
